You can chat away with the last 10 messages visible.  You can click on the pen to check out your profile information or log out.  You can also see who's online right now!

> Pop-ups-a-plenty

If you mess up, the app will be sure to let you know.

Check out your display name and e-mail. Maybe in the near future your avatar.  Click on the gear to change any of it.

Just make sure you remember your password... because it'll ask for it again.

> Editing your profile

You can update your name, e-mail, or password.  You can do it all at once or you can change just one and leave the rest blank.  Parley doesn't care!  Once you submit, the changes take effect immediately.

> Great save!
